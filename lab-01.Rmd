#visitors %>% count(_____)
```
```
> visitors %>% count(region)
# A tibble: 12 × 2
   region                       n

# Summarising Data

## Question 6

_What are the mean and median visitor numbers in 2022 across all attractions?_

```{r Q6}
visitors %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_2022 = mean(n_2022),

```


### Exercise h.

_Perform the same calculation for the 2021 admissions data._

```{r Ex_h}
#visitors %>% 
#  ______(
#    __________,
#    __________
#  )
```

All values in the output are `NA`!

### Exercise i.

_What does `NA` stand for and why are you getting this as your answer to the previous question._

**Write your answer here**




### Exercise j.

_Look at the help pages for the `mean()` and `median()` commands to see what the input argument `na.rm` does. Edit your code from exercise h so that it computes the summary statistics where data is available._

**Write your answer here**




## Question 7

_Which setting (inside, outside or mixed) has the largest mean visitor numbers in 2022?_

```{r Q7}
visitors %>% 
  group_by(setting) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_2022 = mean(n_2022),
    med_2022 = median(n_2022)
  )
```

### Exercise k.

_Observe in question 6 that the mean statistics across all settings are much larger than the corresponding median statistics. Discuss in your group what this suggests about the data._

**Write your answer here**




## Question 8

_What is the interquartile range (the width of the middle 50% of data set between the lower and upper quartiles) the for each of the four nations of the UK?_

```{r Q8}
visitors_with_nations <- visitors %>%
  mutate(
    nation = case_when(
      region == "Northern Ireland" ~ "Northern Ireland",
      region == "Scotland" ~ "Scotland",
      region == "Wales" ~ "Wales",
      TRUE ~ "England"
    )
  )

visitors_with_nations %>% 
  group_by(nation) %>%
  summarise(
    IQR_2022 = IQR(n_2022)
  )
```

### Exercise l.

_How many tourist attractions are there in each of the 4 nations? From this, discuss in your group how reliable you think the inter-quartile estimates are._

#  ______(_______)

_Within each of the 4 nations, what is the proportion of tourist attractions that have free admission for all visitors?_

```{r Ex_m}
# Write your code here


```


### Exercise n.

_Calculate the percentage change in visitor admissions from 2021 to 2022. Of the tourist attractions in Scotland, sort into increasing numerical order the types of admission charges based on the mean percentage change in visitor numbers._
